## Overview

In this project, I developed an advanced tenant management platform called Jarwo AI using cutting-edge AI and web technologies. The platform leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide intelligent data management and insights for custom tenant configurations. By combining modern web frameworks with AI capabilities, we created a powerful solution that helps users efficiently manage and analyze their data across different tenants.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Tenant Management**: Implemented RAG system for intelligent data processing and retrieval across tenants
- **Custom Data Schemas**: Developed flexible schema management allowing users to define their own data structures
- **Vector Search**: Integrated PostgreSQL vector search for efficient similarity-based data retrieval
- **Real-time Analytics**: Created dynamic dashboards for monitoring tenant performance and usage metrics
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Built a secure system supporting multiple isolated tenant environments

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js for building modern, responsive user interfaces
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for robust API development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with vector extensions for efficient data storage and similarity search
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for advanced natural language processing
- **Vector Storage**: pgvector for efficient vector similarity search
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for secure user authentication

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was implementing efficient vector search across multiple tenants while maintaining data isolation. This was solved by implementing a sophisticated indexing strategy and query optimization. Another significant challenge was ensuring the RAG system provided accurate and relevant responses, which required careful prompt engineering and context management.

## Outcome

Jarwo AI has successfully revolutionized tenant management by introducing AI-powered features and intelligent data processing. The implementation of RAG and vector search has significantly improved data retrieval accuracy and user experience. The platform continues to evolve with new AI capabilities and improved tenant management features based on user feedback.
