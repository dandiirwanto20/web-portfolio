- **End-to-End Testing**: Using testing frameworks to validate the entire application flow from user interface to backend services.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was handling the large volume of restaurant data and user reviews while maintaining fast response times. This was solved by implementing efficient database queries and caching strategies. Another significant challenge was ensuring the accuracy of personalized recommendations, which required careful algorithm tuning and continuous testing.
