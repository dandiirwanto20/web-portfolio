## Overview

Development of a diabetes diagnosis calculator application using PHP and jQuery, focusing on providing accurate calculations and assessments for diabetes risk factors, blood glucose levels, and management metrics.

## Key Features

- **Risk Assessment Calculator**: Built a comprehensive calculation system that allows users to assess diabetes risk based on various health parameters, including BMI, blood pressure, and family history.
- **Blood Glucose Monitoring**: Implemented a robust tracking system where users can input and monitor their blood glucose readings, with automatic categorization of results.
- **Treatment Recommendations**: Developed an algorithm that suggests appropriate management strategies based on calculated risk factors and current health status.
- **Data Visualization**: Created interactive charts and graphs using jQuery to help users better understand their health metrics and trends.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: For building the backend calculation engine and data processing.
- **jQuery**: For frontend interactivity and dynamic data visualization.
- **MySQL**: For storing user data and calculation history.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and user-friendly interface design.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was ensuring the accuracy of medical calculations while maintaining a user-friendly interface. This was solved by implementing thorough validation and error checking. Another significant challenge was creating an intuitive user experience for non-technical users, which required careful UI/UX design and clear documentation.

## Outcome

The application successfully helps healthcare professionals and patients make informed decisions about diabetes management. The implementation of accurate calculations and user-friendly interface has significantly improved the accessibility of diabetes risk assessment, leading to better health outcomes. The system continues to evolve with additional features and improved accuracy in calculations.
