## Overview

In this project, I developed an advanced wedding venue discovery platform called TempatNikah AI using cutting-edge AI and web technologies. The platform leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide intelligent venue recommendations and personalized assistance for couples planning their wedding. By combining modern web frameworks with AI capabilities, we created a powerful solution that helps users efficiently find and compare wedding venues based on their preferences and requirements.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Venue Discovery**: Implemented RAG system for intelligent venue recommendations and personalized assistance
- **Smart Search**: Developed advanced search functionality allowing users to find venues based on location, capacity, style, and budget
- **Vector Search**: Integrated PostgreSQL vector search for efficient similarity-based venue matching
- **Real-time Availability**: Created dynamic booking system for checking venue availability and making reservations
- **AI Chatbot Assistant**: Built an intelligent chatbot that helps users find venues based on their preferences and requirements

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js for building modern, responsive user interfaces
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for robust API development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with vector extensions for efficient data storage and similarity search
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for advanced natural language processing
- **Vector Storage**: pgvector for efficient vector similarity search
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: DigitalOcean for scalable and reliable hosting
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for secure user authentication

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was implementing efficient vector search for venue recommendations while maintaining accurate and relevant results. This was solved by implementing a sophisticated indexing strategy and query optimization. Another significant challenge was ensuring the RAG system provided accurate and helpful responses for venue recommendations, which required careful prompt engineering and context management.

## Outcome

TempatNikah AI has successfully revolutionized wedding venue discovery by introducing AI-powered features and intelligent recommendations. The implementation of RAG and vector search has significantly improved venue matching accuracy and user experience. The platform continues to evolve with new AI capabilities and improved venue discovery features based on user feedback.
